# Master Thesis Utilies

This repository contains scripts used in my master thesis. This repository structure is inspired by the QUIC Interop runner. However I chose t`o have a custom repository in order to fully match my needs. 

## Structure

- `results/`: Contains the results
- `configs/`: Contains config files, that will be used in order to provide flexibility in term of perfomance analysis.
- `runner/`: Contains the scripts used to run the runner.
